/*
    Fuel Status API 1.0
    This API allows to determine the fuel level and remaining
    distance of connected arik-Benz vehicles remotely.
    Data is categorized into resources and containers for the
    polling interface. They are defined as follows:
    * *Resource*: A resource is a single information about a
    vehicle. It's a measurement that consists of a name (also
    referred to as resource ID), a value, and an associated
    timestamp. See below for a list and description of all
    resources that this API provides.
    * *Container*: A container is a set of resources that are
    defined to group data for a certain use case.
    
    The interface is a ISO 20078-compliant REST endpoint to
    query the latest data for a vehicle. If the vehicle did not
    send an update for a resource within 11 hours, the response
    will be empty.
    ## Resources
    This is an alphabetical list of all resources that the API
    provides.
    Name | Description | Unit/Range
    ---- | ----------- | ----------
    rangeliquid | Liquid fuel tank range | 0..2046 km
    tanklevelpercent |     Liquid fuel tank level | 0â€¦100 %
